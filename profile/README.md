The `Orchy Project` consists in a bunch of utilities and templates that can help you to easily implement the [Micro Frontends](https://micro-frontends.org/) pattern in a performant way.

All of this is possible thanks to an open source [Web Component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) which aims to orchestrate multiple multi-tenant frontend applications leveraging on the following technologies:

- [Micro Frontends](https://micro-frontends.org/) pattern;
- [JavaScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules);
- [Server Driven UI](https://www.judo.app/blog/server-driven-ui/).

Each UI and each Micro Frontend is managed using the Client Side Composition variant of the Micro Frontend pattern.

Thanks to the out of the box support to Server Driven UI, `orchy` also supports both **horizontal** and **vertical** split of the view.
